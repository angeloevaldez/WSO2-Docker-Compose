# Docker WSO2 Project

## Docker base images

For now, since the bases are pretty generic, I have a repo of the dockerfiles at https://github.com/eristoddle/dockerfiles. I used that repo to build the base boxes and push the images to my Docker Hub account, again public since they are generic: https://hub.docker.com/u/eristoddle/

## Getting Started

- Make sure you have docker installed.
- Run `docker-compose up` in this projects directory
